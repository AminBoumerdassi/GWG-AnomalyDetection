# TGWN-AnomalyDetection (read "tee-gwin")
### Transient Gravitational Wave Noise Anomaly Detection
A convolutional autoencoder trained on transient gravitational wave noise (glitches) from the Gravity Spy database.
Its purpose is for anomaly detection (non-anomaly=glitches, anomaly=astrophysical transient events).
If successful, this will form the glitch rejection mechanism for the GW-ML burst detection pipeline MLy.
